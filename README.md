# SQLAlchemy Climate Analysis and Flask API

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting a climate analysis and building a Flask API for accessing the analysis results. The analysis utilizes Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore climate data from a SQLite database. The Flask API is designed to serve the analysis results through various endpoints.

## Features
- Analyze and explore climate data from a SQLite database.
- Perform precipitation and station analysis using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Design a Flask API with routes to access precipitation, station, and temperature observation data.
- Utilize SQLAlchemy to interact with the SQLite database and perform queries.
- Implement Flask routes to serve JSON representation of analysis results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sqlalchemy-challenge.git
    ```
2. Set up your environment and install dependencies.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter notebook `climate_starter.ipynb` to conduct the climate analysis and explore the data.
4. Implement Flask routes as specified in `app.py` for the API.
